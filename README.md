# Credit Card Validator in Python

## Overview
This project is a **Credit Card Validator** built using Python, utilizing the Luhn algorithm to validate credit card numbers. It can check the structural validity of the card and identify the card type (Visa, MasterCard, etc.).

## Features
- **Luhn Algorithm Implementation**: Validates credit card numbers for structural correctness.
- **Card Type Identification**: Recognizes the type of credit card (Visa, MasterCard, etc.) based on the number.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Simple CLI for users to input card numbers and receive validation feedback.
- **Error Handling**: Provides clear error messages for invalid inputs or incorrectly formatted card numbers.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IT21314742/credit-card-validator.git


**How It Works**
The project uses the _Luhn algorithm,_ which checks if the provided credit card number is valid by summing digits and ensuring the total is divisible by 10. It also identifies the card type by analyzing the number‚Äôs prefix and length.

Card Types Supported
- Visa
- MasterCard
- American Express
- Discover
