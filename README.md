# credit card validator
 This project is a Credit Card Validator developed using Python. It implements the Luhn algorithm (also known as the Modulus 10 algorithm) to verify the validity of credit card numbers. The validator checks whether a given card number is structurally valid and can identify card types (Visa, MasterCard, etc.).
